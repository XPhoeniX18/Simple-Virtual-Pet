# Virtual Pet Game

A simple virtual pet game created with Python and Tkinter.

## Description

This is a basic virtual pet game where you take care of a pet by feeding it and playing with it. The pet has two main attributes: hunger and happiness. Your goal is to keep these attributes balanced. If the pet's hunger reaches 100 or its happiness drops to 0, the pet will die. If you manage to keep the pet's hunger below 90 and happiness at 100, the pet will live a long and happy life!

## Features

- **Feed the Pet:** Increases the pet's hunger by 10 and decreases its happiness by 5.
- **Play with the Pet:** Increases the pet's happiness by 10 and decreases its hunger by 5.
- **Automatic Updates:** The pet's hunger increases and happiness decreases over time.
